### for local state endeavour to use native statemanagement tools like

### use state, usemomo, usereducer, usecalback etc

### when u get to useffect consider an external librayr like react-query or swr they will probaly do a better job of mangaging the query state

### a combination of native state plus react-query should be enough for an average application

### if you have additional need for global state look into context for native, or opt for zustand,jotai, redux, valtio etc for nonnative
